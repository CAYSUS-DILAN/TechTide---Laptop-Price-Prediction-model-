      # TechTide---Laptop-Price-Prediction-model-
      TechTide is a machine learning project that predicts laptop prices based on various features like brand, specifications, and more. The model is built using the Random Forest  Regression algorithm and utilizes popular Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib,  sklearn to  preprocess data, visualize insights, and build a predictive model.

      Prerequisites
      Python 3.x
      Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
      Basic knowledge of machine learning and data science
      Steps
      Clone the repository:
      
      bash
      Copy code
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/TechTide.git
      cd TechTide
      Install dependencies: You can install the required libraries using pip:
      
      bash
      Copy code
      pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
      Run the notebook: Open the TechTide.ipynb notebook file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to preprocess the data, visualize features, and train the prediction model.
      
      Usage
      Load the data: The dataset includes various laptop features such as brand, RAM, CPU, and screen size. Load the data using pandas:
      
      python
      Copy code
      import pandas as pd
      data = pd.read_csv('laptop_prices.csv')
      Train the model: The Random Forest model can be trained using the following code:
      
      python
      Copy code
      from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
      model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
      model.fit(X_train, y_train)
      Make predictions: Once the model is trained, you can predict laptop prices:
      
      python
      Copy code
      predictions = model.predict(X_test)
      Visualize results: Use seaborn and matplotlib to visualize important features and the model's predictions:
      
      python
      Copy code
      import seaborn as sns
      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      sns.barplot(x=feature_names, y=model.feature_importances_)
      Data Description
      The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
      
      Brand: Manufacturer of the laptop.
      RAM: Size of the RAM in GB.
      CPU: Type of processor.
      Screen Size: Laptop screen size.
      Price: The target variable indicating the laptop's price.
      Features
      Random Forest model for high accuracy.
      Data visualization with seaborn and matplotlib.
      Predictive analysis for laptop prices.
      Feature importance analysis to determine the most significant factors influencing price.
      Model
      The model used for this project is a Random Forest Regressor, which is known for its ability to handle complex datasets and provide accurate predictions. The model performs well on this dataset due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships between laptop features and their prices.
